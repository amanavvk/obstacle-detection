# LiDAR point-cloud based 3D object detection

## Overview

LiDAR is one of the prominent sensors to provide the 3D information of the object in terms of the point cloud to localize the objects and characterize the shapes. therefore, LiDAR is used for 3D Object detection and tracking.

This project is about detecting obstacles from highly sparse LiDAR point cloud and tracking multiple objects in real time.
